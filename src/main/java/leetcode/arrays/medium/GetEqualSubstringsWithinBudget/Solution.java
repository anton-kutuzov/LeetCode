/*
You are given two strings s and t of the same length. You want to change s to t.
Changing the i-th character of s to i-th character of t costs |s[i] - t[i]| that is, the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters.
You are also given an integer maxCost.
Return the maximum length of a substring of s that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of twith a cost less than or equal to maxCost.
If there is no substring from s that can be changed to its corresponding substring from t, return 0.

Example:
Given:
s = "abcd", t = "bcdf", maxCost = 3
Result:
3
Explanation: "abc" of s can change to "bcd". That costs 3, so the maximum length is 3.
